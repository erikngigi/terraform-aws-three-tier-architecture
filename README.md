# Magento Three-Tier AWS Infrastucture - Provisioned with Terraform

---

## Project Overview

This repository will contain Terraform code and documentation to deploy a secure, scalable, and maintainable three-tier architecture for **Magento** on **AWS**. The intent is to provide a reusable reference implementation that teams can adapt for development, staging, and production environments.

---

## Status

**Placeholder / Not started.**
This README is a project scaffold — no infrastructure, code, or Terraform modules exist yet. Use this document to guide design, implementation, and contributions.

---

## Planned Features

* **Infrastructure as Code**

  * Terraform modules for repeatable components (networking, compute, database, caching, security).
* **Networking**

  * VPC, public & private subnets, NAT/IGW, Route 53 for DNS.
* **Compute**

  * Auto Scaling for web and application layers (EC2 or container-based options like ECS/EKS).
* **Persistence**

  * Managed RDS (MySQL/MariaDB/Aurora) for Magento data with automated backups.
* **Caching & Search**

  * ElastiCache (Redis) for sessions/cache; OpenSearch (optional) for catalog search.
* **Storage & CDN**

  * S3 for media/static assets and CloudFront for global delivery.
* **Load Balancing**

  * Application Load Balancer for HTTP(S) traffic with health checks.
* **Security**

  * Least-privilege IAM roles, Security Groups, NACLs, AWS WAF, ACM-managed TLS certificates, KMS for encryption.
* **Operational Excellence**

  * CloudWatch metrics, logs, alerts, centralized logging.
* **CI/CD**

  * Reference pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions / AWS CodePipeline) for Terraform, image builds and application deploys.
* **Compliance & Scanning**

  * IaC linting (tflint), formatting (`terraform fmt`), static security scanning (checkov/terrascan).
* **Testing**

  * `terraform validate`, `terraform plan` gating; Terratest for integration tests.

## Architecture (intended)

A canonical Three-Tier model:

* **Presentation (Web) Tier**

  * ALB → web servers serving static content (S3/CloudFront) and forwarding dynamic requests to the app tier.
* **Application (App) Tier**

  * PHP-FPM / FPM workers (EC2 Auto Scaling or containers) running Magento application code.
  * Connects to cache, search, and DB.
* **Database (DB) Tier**

  * Managed RDS/Aurora for transactional data. Private subnets only.

Additional components: S3 (media), ElastiCache (Redis) for sessions/cache, CloudFront, Route53, IAM, Secrets Manager/SSM Parameter Store.

## Getting Started (Planned)

**Prerequisites**

* AWS account and appropriate permissions (IAM user/role).
* Terraform (pinned version to be defined).
* AWS CLI configured.
* Recommended tools: `tflint`, `terraform-docs`, `checkov`.

**Planned Quick-start steps**

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone git@github.com:your-org/magento-3tier-aws-terraform.git
cd magento-3tier-aws-terraform

# 2. Select environment (example)
cd envs/dev

# 3. Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# 4. Review plan
terraform plan -var-file=dev.tfvars

# 5. Apply (after review)
terraform apply -var-file=dev.tfvars
```

> Note: The above commands are placeholders. Detailed variable lists, backend configuration, and secure secrets handling (Secrets Manager / SSM) will be provided once implementation begins.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Planned guidelines:

* Open an issue to propose features or report problems.
* Fork, create a feature branch, and open a PR with a clear description.
* Run `terraform fmt`, `terraform validate`, and linting before creating PRs.
* PRs should include a short test plan and reviewer assignment.
* Use semantic commit messages; link PRs to issues.

A `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and PR/issue templates will be added when development starts.

## Roadmap & Milestones (planned)

1. **Repository skeleton** — modules directory, env layout, README, CONTRIBUTING.
2. **Core networking** — VPC, subnets, routing, base IAM roles.
3. **Compute basics** — web/app ASGs or container baseline, ALB.
4. **Data and cache** — RDS, ElastiCache.
5. **Storage & CDN** — S3 + CloudFront, media handling.
6. **CI/CD & testing** — pipelines, validation and tests.
7. **Security hardening & monitoring** — WAF, KMS, CloudWatch dashboards, alerts.
8. **Documentation & runbooks** — production runbooks, troubleshooting guides.

## License

TBD — A license will be chosen and added before the first release (suggested options: **Apache-2.0** or **MIT**).
